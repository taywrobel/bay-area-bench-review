Benches are a wonderful thing.  Often placed in scenic and serene locales, far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  And the inhabitants of the Bay Area are no strangers to hustle and bustle.

For our inaugural review, we will be looking at a bench in the heart of silicon valley, overlooking the bay from the West coastline.

## View

Looks real purdy from here.

## Comfort

Bench is comfortable enough.  The smell can be off-putting at low tide, however.

## Accessibility

Off of the bay trail, it is best to bike to this scenic spot.  Just get on behind the City of Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant and head North.  This bench is clearly visible off the right side of the path, about a quarter mile along.
